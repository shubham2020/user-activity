# User Activity

## API endpoint to get the JSON data
https://user-activiti.herokuapp.com/member/apis/member-activity/

## File Orgnaization
1. Modified slightly the file structure to meet the development and production environments separate
2. Have kept the api, http routes and views separate keeping into consideration that their
   individual purposes can be later used without any interference
3. Have split the Member and Activity apps to keep them independent for future purposes where Member
   may be required by other apps and Activity in itself grows to accomodate more features
